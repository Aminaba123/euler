I used a statistical approach to solve this problem. 
Essentially, these are the steps I used:

1. For each successful login attempt in the file, make a note of the characters and their position. For example, if the attempt is '319', we would note that '3' is at position 0, '1' is at position 1, and '9' is at position 2. These results are stored in a dictionary of lists, where the keys are the characters and the values are a list of all positions where that character is found.
2. Next, we calculate the average position of each character. To do this we simply divide the sum of the character's positions by the number of times the character appeared.
3. Then, we sort the dictionary by value, so that characters with a smaller average position appear before those with a greater average position. 
4. Finally, we concatenate the sorted characters and return this as the result.
