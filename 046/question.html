It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
9 &amp; = 7 + 2\times1^2 \\
15 &amp; = 7 + 2\times2^2 \\
21 &amp; = 3 + 2\times3^2 \\
25 &amp; = 7 + 2\times3^2 \\
27 &amp; = 19 + 2\times2^2 \\
33 &amp; = 31 + 2\times1^2
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
