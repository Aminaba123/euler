A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal 
representation of the unit fractions with denominators 
2 to 10 are given:

\\[
\\begin{align*}
1/2   &=  0.5
\\\\ 1/3   &=  0.\\overline{3}
\\\\ 1/4   &=  0.25
\\\\ 1/5   &=  0.2
\\\\ 1/6   &=  0.1\\overline{6}
\\\\ 1/7   &=  0.\\overline{142857}
\\\\ 1/8   &=  0.125
\\\\ 1/9   &=  0.\\overline{1}
\\\\ 1/10  &=  0.1
\\]

Where \\(0.1\\overline{6}\\) means \\(0.1666\\dots\\), and has a 1-digit recurring 
cycle. It can be seen that \\(\frac{1}{7}\\) has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of \\(d < 1000\\) for which \\(\\frac{1}{d}\\) contains the longest 
recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
