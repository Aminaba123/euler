<p>
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal 
representation of the unit fractions with denominators 
2 to 10 are given:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
1/2&amp;=0.5 \\
1/3&amp;=0.\overline{3} \\
1/4&amp;=0.25 \\
1/5&amp;=0.2 \\
1/6&amp;=0.1\overline{6} \\
1/7&amp;=0.\overline{142857} \\
1/8&amp;=0.125 \\
1/9&amp;=0.\overline{1} \\
1/10&amp;=0.1
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
Where \(0.1\overline{6}\) means \(0.1666\dots\), and has a 1-digit recurring 
cycle. It can be seen that \(\frac{1}{7}\) has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
</p>

<p>
Find the value of \(d &lt; 1000\) for which \(\frac{1}{d}\) contains the longest 
recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
