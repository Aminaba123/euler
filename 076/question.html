<p>
It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
4 &amp;+ 1 \\\\
3 &amp;+ 2 \\\\
3 &amp;+ 1 + 1 \\\\
2 &amp;+ 2 + 1 \\\\
2 &amp;+ 1 + 1 + 1 \\\\
1 &amp;+ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?
