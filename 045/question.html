<p>
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Triangle} &amp; T_n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} &amp; 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots \\\\
\text{Pentagonal} &amp; P_n=\frac{n(3n−1)}{2} &amp; 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \dots \\\\
\text{Hexagonal} &amp; H_n=n(2n−1) &amp; 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \dots 
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
It can be verified that \(T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755\).
</p>

<p>
Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
