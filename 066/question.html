<p>
Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
</p>
$$
x^2-Dy^2=1
$$
<p>
For example, when $D=13$, the minimal solution in $x$ is $6492 – 131802 = 1$.
</p>
<p>
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when $D$ is square.
</p>
<p>
By finding minimal solutions in $x$ for $D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}$, we obtain the following:
</p>
$$
\begin{align*}
3^2 – 2 \times 2^2 &amp;= 1 \\
2^2 – 3 \times 1^2 &amp;= 1 \\
9^2 – 5 \times 4^2 &amp;= 1 \\
5^2 – 6 \times 2^2 &amp;= 1 \\
8^2 – 7 \times 3^2 &amp;= 1
\end{align*}
$$
<p>
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in $x$ for $D \leq 7$, the largest $x$ is obtained when $D=5$.
</p>
<p>
Find the value of $D \leq 1000$ in minimal solutions of $x$ for which the largest value of $x$ is obtained.
