\(\newcommand{\pounds}{\mathit{\unicode{xA3}}}\)In England the currency is made up of pounds, \(\pounds\), and pence, \(p\), and there are eight coins in general circulation:
</p>

\[1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, \pounds1 \: (100p) \text{ and } \pounds2 \: (200p)\]

<p>
It is possible to make \(\pounds2\) in the following way:
</p>

\[1\times\pounds1 + 1\times50p + 2\times20p + 1\times5p + 1\times2p + 3\times1p\]

<p>
How many different ways can \(\pounds2\) be made using any number of coins?
