<p>
An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:
</p>

$$0.123456789101112131415161718192021...$$

<p>
It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.
</p>

<p>
If $d_n$ represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.
</p>

$$d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \times d_{10000} \times d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}$$
