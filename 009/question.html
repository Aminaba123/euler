<p>
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, \(a &lt; b &lt; c\), 
for which
</p>

\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]

<p>
For example, \(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2\).
</p>

<p>
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which \(a + b + c = 1000\).
Find the product \(a \times b \times c\).
