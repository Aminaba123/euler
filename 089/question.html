The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each number 
(see <a href="http://projecteuler.net/about=roman_numerals">About Roman Numerals...</a>). However, there 
is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number sixteen:
</p>

<pre>
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
</pre>

<p>
The last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number 
of numerals.

The 11K text file, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/project/roman.txt">roman.txt</a> (right click and 
'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not 
necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged in descending units 
and obey the subtractive pair rule (see <a href="http://projecteuler.net/about=roman_numerals">About Roman Numerals...</a> 
for the definitive rules for this problem).

Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than 
four consecutive identical units.
