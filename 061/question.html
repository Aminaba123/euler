<p>
Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Triangle } &amp; P_{3,n}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} &amp; 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots \\
\text{Square } &amp; P_{4,n}=n^2 &amp; 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \dots \\
\text{Pentagonal } &amp; P_{5,n}=\frac{n(3n−1)}{2} &amp; 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \dots \\
\text{Hexagonal } &amp; P_{6,n}=n(2n−1) &amp; 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \dots \\
\text{Heptagonal } &amp; P_{7,n}=\frac{n(5n−3)}{2} &amp; 1, 7, 18, 34, 55, \dots \\
\text{Octagonal } &amp; P_{8,n}=n(3n−2) &amp; 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, \dots
\end{aligned}

<p>
The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).</li>
	<li>Each polygonal type: triangle (\(P_{3,127}=8128\)), square (\(P_{4,91}=8281\)), and pentagonal (\(P_{5,44}=2882\)), is represented by a different number in the set.</li>
	<li>This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.
