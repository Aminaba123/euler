<p>
It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.
</p>

\[
\sqrt{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \dots}}} = 1.414213\dots
\]

<p>
By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
1 + \frac{1}{2} &amp; = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\\\
1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}} &amp; = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4 \\\\
1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}} &amp; = \frac{17}{12} = 1.41666\dots \\\\
1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}} &amp; = \frac{41}{29} = 1.41379\dots
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
The next three expansions are \(\frac{99}{70}\), \(\frac{239}{169}\), and \(\frac{577}{408}\), but the eighth expansion, \(\frac{1393}{985}\), is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
</p>

<p>
In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?
